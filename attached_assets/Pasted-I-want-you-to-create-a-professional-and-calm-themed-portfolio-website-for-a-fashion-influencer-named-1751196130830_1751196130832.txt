I want you to create a professional and calm-themed portfolio website for a fashion influencer named Priya Dhurve. She is a medico by profession and a fashion, lifestyle & exploration influencer by passion. The website should reflect both elegance and professionalism, using calm colors like soft beige, blush pink, off-white, or pastel tones.

The website must include:

1. Home Page
Hero banner featuring 2–3 of her best photos (from the uploaded 19 images).

Her name in bold (e.g., "Priya Dhurve") and tagline like "Fashion | Lifestyle | Exploration"

A clean, modern layout

2. About Section
A short bio:

"Medico by profession | Fashion, Exploration & Lifestyle by passion"

Add location: Betul ➜ Bhopal

Mention: “Open for Freelancing & Collaborations”

3. Gallery Section
Display all 19 uploaded images in a masonry-style gallery or carousel slider

Add lightbox effect when clicked

4. Editorials Section
A section that looks like a magazine layout or editorial photo blog (like the first reference image with full-width photos)

Use 4–5 handpicked images from the gallery for this

5. Polaroids Section
Styled like Instagram story highlights (minimalist circles with shadow)

Optional caption hover effect

Can reuse some images from her Instagram highlights

6. Contact Section
Include contact email: durgadhurve527@gmail.com

Instagram handle: @belike_._priya

A simple contact form (name, email, message)

A statement: "Let’s collaborate!"

7. Navigation Bar
Sticky on top with links: Home | Editorials | Polaroids | About | Contact

Elegant font like Poppins, Lora, or DM Serif Display

8. Footer
Instagram and social icons

“© 2025 Priya Dhurve. All rights reserved.”

✨ Extra Styling Notes:
Use calm color palette: beige, off-white, soft gold, dusty rose

Font: Modern serif/sans-serif mix

Add subtle animations on scroll

Responsive design for mobile and tablet

Upload and reference the 19 provided photos properly. Prioritize image quality and layout. Use HTML, CSS (with flex or grid), and JS for basic interactivity. Avoid dark themes. The overall vibe should be classy, soft, editorial, and welcoming.
